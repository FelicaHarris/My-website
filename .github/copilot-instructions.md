# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be the starting point for a website project. As of now, it contains only a `README.md` file and no source code, configuration, or documentation about frameworks, build systems, or deployment processes.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- **Project Structure**: The project is currently empty except for the `README.md`. There are no source files, build scripts, or configuration files present.
- **Assumptions**: If you are tasked with adding code, clarify with the user which technology stack (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS, React, Python, etc.) and project structure to use.
- **Conventions**: No project-specific conventions or patterns are established yet. Follow best practices for the chosen stack unless directed otherwise.
- **Workflows**: There are no build, test, or deployment workflows defined. If you need to add them, ask the user for their preferred tools and processes.
- **Documentation**: Update this file as the project evolves to reflect new patterns, workflows, and conventions.

## Next Steps
- When adding new components, document their purpose and structure here.
- If integrating with external services or adding dependencies, note them in this file.
- As the project grows, describe any non-standard patterns or workflows that emerge.
